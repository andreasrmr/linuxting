mssql-tools Installation Steps (source)

This section covers setting up of mssql-tools which includes the sqlcmd command. These steps are needed for any systems in which you wish to use the sqlcmd command or other Microsoft-originating utilities on Linux to interact with an MSSQL Server.

(This is not required for other Python libraries for interacting with MSSQL, or other utilities such as DataGrip which can interact with servers, etc., which do not need the mssql-tools pacakge to operate.)

    Caveats:

        I have not found a version of this for non-64bit systems. You may need a 64bit system to make these tools work.
        You can only use tools on 16.04 currently.

    Enter Superuser Mode

    sudo su

    Import the public repository GPG keys:

    curl https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc | apt-key add -

    Register the Microsoft Ubuntu repository:

    curl https://packages.microsoft.com/config/ubuntu/16.04/prod.list > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/msprod.list

    Exit superuser mode:

    exit

    Update the sources list and run the installation command:

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install mssql-tools
